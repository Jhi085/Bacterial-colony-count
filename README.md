# Automated colony phenotype detection from image
This tool automates the process of counting colonies from petri dish images, categorizing them by size, and providing a visual representation of the analysis. This tool utilizes computer vision techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency in colony quantification.



## Features
- **Automated Colony Detection:** Leverages OpenCV to detect colonies in images.
- **Size Classification:** Classifies colonies into three size categories.
- **Visual Output:** Generates images with highlighted colonies and a bar chart of the colony distribution.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV: Used for image processing.
- NumPy: Supports data handling.
- Matplotlib: Generates output visualizations.
## Installation
Clone the repository to get started with the script:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Colonycount.git

## Usage
Place your petri dish image in the script's directory.
Edit the script to point to your image file.
Execute the script to count the colonies:

python Colonycount.py

## Output
The script provides:

An annotated image with colonies highlighted.
A bar chart visualizing the count of colonies by size.
Saves the processed results to the local directory.
